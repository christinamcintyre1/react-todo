This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I used ReactJs, Javascript, CSS, and HTML to build this app. Tasks can be added, deleted, and marked as complete. I deployed the app using Heroku. The url is to-do-testing.herokuapp.com.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
